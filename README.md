# Module-13
## üìò Overview
This module contains C programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts of stacks, queues, and recursion. Each program is accompanied by a detailed explanation and example output to facilitate understanding.

## üìÇ Contents
conversion_of_infix_to_postfix.md: Explains the algorithm to convert an infix expression to postfix notation using a stack, including a sample C program.

evaluate_postfix.md: Demonstrates how to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack, with a sample C program and step-by-step explanation.

eveluate_prefix_expression.md: Illustrates the evaluation of a prefix expression using a stack, providing a sample C program and detailed walkthrough.

priority_of_operator.md: Discusses operator precedence in expressions and provides a C program to determine the priority of operators in a given expression.

tower_of_hanoi.md: Presents the recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem, including a C program that displays the sequence of moves for 2 disks.
